## Installation

### Basic Installation

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/aaronjensen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
```

Or if you're me and/or you want all my default apps installed (see
`setup/brew.sh`):

### Installation + all my homebrew apps

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/aaronjensen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/setup-all.sh
```

### zsh instead of bash

```bash
$ ./setup-zsh.sh
```

### Other setup scripts

Look in the setup folder for other scripts to run to setup various things.

### iTerm setup

Point your preferences to ~/.dotfiles/iterm in iterm2
