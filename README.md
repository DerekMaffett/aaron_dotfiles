## Installation

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/aaronjensen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
```

Or if you're me and/or you want all my default apps installed (see
`setup/brew.sh`):

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/aaronjensen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/setup-all.sh
```

After that look in the setup folder for other scripts to run to setup various
things.

### iTerm setup

Point your preferences to ~/.dotfiles/iterm in iterm2
